- OpenRouter API key
- 5 minutes of your time

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### **1. Sign Up for Render**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click **"Get Started for Free"**
3. Sign in with your **GitHub** account
4. Authorize Render to access your repositories (including private ones)

### **2. Create Web Service**
1. From your Render dashboard, click **"New +"** in the top right
2. Select **"Web Service"**
3. You'll see a list of your repositories (including your private nanobrowser repo)
4. Select your **nanobrowser** repository
5. Click **"Connect"**

### **3. Configure Service Settings**

Fill out these settings:

**Basic Configuration:**
- **Name**: `nanobrowser-api` (or any name you prefer)
- **Region**: Choose the region closest to your users
  - `Oregon (US West)` - for US West Coast users
  - `Ohio (US East)` - for US East Coast users
  - `Frankfurt (EU)` - for European users
  - `Singapore (Asia)` - for Asian users
- **Branch**: `main` (or your default branch)
- **Root Directory**: `backend-service`
- **Runtime**: `Node`

**Build & Deploy Commands:**
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`

### **4. Set Environment Variables**

Add these environment variables in the **Environment Variables** section:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://*
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100
ENABLE_USAGE_LOGGING=true
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual OpenRouter API key

### **5. Deploy**
1. Click **"Create Web Service"**
2. Render will start building and deploying
3. Watch the deployment logs in real-time
4. Wait for completion (usually 2-5 minutes)

---

## üåê After Deployment

### **Get Your Service URL**
Once deployed, you'll receive a URL like:
```
https://einanoshou.onrender.com
```

### **Test Your API**
Test that your API is working:
```bash
curl https://einanoshou.onrender.com/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-XX...",
  "uptime": "XX.XX seconds"
}
```

## üîÑ Extension Updates

**Good news!** Your extension is already configured to use your Render URL:
- `https://einanoshou.onrender.com/api/chat/completions`

The extension will automatically:
1. Initialize the centralized API provider on startup
2. Set it as the default (no API key required)
3. Show "„Ç®„Ç§„Éä„Éº„ÅÆAI (API„Ç≠„Éº‰∏çË¶Å)" in the settings

---

## üìä Monitoring & Management

### **View Logs**
- Go to your service dashboard on Render
- Click the **"Logs"** tab to see real-time logs
- Monitor API requests and errors

### **Check Usage Stats**
Visit your API's stats endpoint:
```
https://einanoshou.onrender.com/stats
```

### **Scaling**
Render's free tier includes:
- 750 hours/month of runtime
- Automatic sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Automatic wake-up on first request

For higher usage, upgrade to a paid plan for:
- Always-on service (no sleeping)
- More compute resources
- Priority support

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Service Won't Start**
1. Check the **Logs** tab for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure `PORT=10000` is set (Render's default port)

### **API Returns Errors**
1. Check your OpenRouter API key is valid
2. Verify the CORS settings allow chrome extensions
3. Check rate limiting isn't too restrictive

### **Extension Can't Connect**
1. Verify your service URL is correct
2. Check the service is running (not sleeping)
3. Test the `/health` endpoint manually
